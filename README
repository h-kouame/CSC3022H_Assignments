The assignment was done using Visual Studio Community 15
As specified in the assignment, the parameters can be changed 
in the clean_slate/params.ini file
depending on the environment (among the 3 envs),
an output file will be generated logging the number of mines swept
and the number of destroyed sweepers.
so we will have "env_1_log.csv" "env_2_log.csv" and "env_3_log.csv"

open the project by opening the clean_slate/smart sweepers.vcxproj in visual studio preferably 2015.
